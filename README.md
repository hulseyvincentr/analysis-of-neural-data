# analysis-of-neural-data
The code here contains homework assignments and demonstration code, all in the form of Jupyter notebooks, from the course Analysis of Neural Data at the University of Oregon (Spring 2021). 

The first notebook is a general introduction to Python, with an emphasis on numerical computing with Numpy. This may be useful for anyone who is new to using Python for technical computing.

The other notebooks illustrate concepts from statistics, applying these to the analysis of synthetic data, as well as datasets from real neuroscience experiments in mice, borrowed from the Neuromatch Academy 2020 online summer school for computational neuroscience.

Feedback pointing out mistakes or suggestions for improvements is very welcome.
